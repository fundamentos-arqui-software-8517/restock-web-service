/**
 * Domain event representing the inventory level of a batch in a specific branch falling below the minimum stock level.

It captures the details of the inventory level, including the branch and batch identifiers, the current stock, the minimum stock level, and the unit of measurement. This event can be used for inventory management and restocking purposes to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to replenish stock levels and avoid stockouts.
